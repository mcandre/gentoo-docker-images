## Policy

* use topic branches (i.e. foo) and fix branches (i.e. fix/foo) when submitting
  pull requests
* make meaningful commits ideally with the following form:
  * subject line–what this commit does
  * blank line
  * body–why this commit is necessary or desired
* pull requests should not include merge commits
* use amend and rebase to fix commits after a pull request has been submitted
